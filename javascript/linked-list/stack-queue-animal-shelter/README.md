## Whiteboard Process
![](./challenge12.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
we used the same method from previous challenges and same process so the time and complexity will remain the same which is **big O (1)**

created 2 methods enqueue and dequeue and they function the same as i mentioned in previous challenges

* enqueue BigO ---> O(1);
* dequeue BigO ---> O(1);

## Solution

*animalShelter.test.js*
