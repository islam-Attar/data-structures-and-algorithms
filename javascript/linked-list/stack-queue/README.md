# Stacks and Queues
Stack and Queues are data structures that follow different patterns the Stack has a vertical shape FILO/LIFO and  the Queues has horizontal FIFO/LILO

# Challenge
The challange asked us to add (push, pop, peak, isEmpty) For the Stack class and (enqueue, dequeue, peak, isEmpty) For the Queue.

# Approach & Efficiency

## Stack complexity
`push(value)` space and time complexity of `BigO (1)` because we don't use any loops and just add to the top of the stack

`pop()` space and time complexity of `BigO (1)` because we don't use any loops and just delete the top of the stack

`peak()` space and time complexity of `BigO (1)` because we just return the top value of the stack

`isEmpty()` space and time complexity of `BigO (1)` because we just check if there is a top and return a boolean


## Queue complexity
`enqueue(value)` space and time complexity of `BigO (1)` because we don't use any loops and just add to the front of the queue

`dequeue()` space and time complexity of `BigO (1)` because we don't use any loops and just delete the first node of the queue

`peak()` space and time complexity of `BigO (1)` because we just return the first value of the queue

`isEmpty()` space and time complexity of `BigO (1)` because we just check if there is a front and return a boolean
