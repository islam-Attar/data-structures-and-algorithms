# Singly Linked List
A linked list is typically used for collecting sequences of objects requiring the need for efficient addition and removal of elements from the middle of the sequence.

## Challenge
Create a Linked List class
Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
also 3 methods that are insert, includes, and toString


## Approach & Efficiency
If you just want to insert an element right to the beginning of the LinkedList, that can be done in constant time O(1).

If you want to traverse an element in the LinkedList, again constant time O(1).
